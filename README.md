Welcome to my final project in module 5 at Flatiron School, 2019 - "PM Influence".

This is a web application to be used as a personal tool for project and programme managers, where they can confidentially manage their project stakeholders. The user register and create projects in the app, they can then register the stakeholders for each project and rate them on Power, Interest and Support. The stakeholders will appear in a Power/Interest chart. The user can change stakeholder ratings and there is also a list of strategies to choose from, when a stakeholder needs influencing.

The application has a Rails API (which is this repository) with 7 models. The frontend is built in React (see separate repository) and includes a chart from Anychart.

 Rails version 5.2.2
